-  I'd like to help others have similar good experiences
-  A little more practice never hurts!

## Presenting: Why
-  Selfish reasons
    -  Become super-duper famous and rich! {not really}
    -  Instead of you looking for opportunities, they look for you
-  Altruistic
    -  Contribute your unique voice to the community
    -  You can help someone learn, just as various people have helped YOU learn
    -  You KNOW you didn't have to PAY anything for Python, right? Has it enabled you to MAKE any money or make your life easier/better/more fun?

## Presenting: How?
-  Start with lightning talks!
    -  Here's how!!
        -  They can be SIMPLE. Focus on a single topic/solution/library.
        -  You don't need to be an "expert". Just share something you've learned or think is worth sharing.
    -  No need to be fancy, you can do a Lightning Talk with index cards. Look, I'll show you!
        -  [PyVideo](http://www.pyvideo.org/) Lightning Talk (index cards only)
    -  Consider the recorded option if you're nervous!
        -  I JUST thought of this recently: it may be a TERRIBLE idea! I'm going to experiment with it.
